# Handover Document - Word Add-in Mastra Migration
Date: 2025-09-12
Status: Backend implementation complete, frontend needs updating

## Project Overview
Migrating Word add-in from custom agent framework to Mastra. The main challenge was that Mastra's tool execution model doesn't wait for async frontend results, causing tools to return immediately with placeholder data.

## Current Architecture
- **Backend**: Express.js server with Mastra agent (port 3000)
- **Frontend**: Word add-in React app (port 3001) 
- **Communication**: SSE streaming for agent responses, tool execution via frontend

## Key Problem Solved
Mastra tools execute synchronously but our Word operations happen asynchronously in the frontend. We implemented a Tool Bridge Pattern using EventEmitter to properly wait for frontend results.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Tool Bridge Pattern (/backend/src/mastra/tools/toolBridge.ts)
- Created `createFrontendTool` helper that wraps Mastra tools
- Uses EventEmitter to bridge async gap between backend and frontend
- Properly extracts args from Mastra's context object (input.context)
- Waits for frontend to send results back via tool-result endpoint

### 2. New Context-Based Tools (/backend/src/mastra/tools/contextTools.ts)
Simplified from complex search-based to position-based approach:
- `insert_text`: Insert at start/end/after/before anchor text
- `replace_text`: Replace paragraph or exact match
- `delete_text`: Remove content using anchors
- `insert_table`: Table insertion with same positioning
- `read_document`: Read full document content
- `add_comment`: Add review comments

Key insight: Use 30-50 character anchors (like coding agents) to avoid Word's 150-char search limit.

### 3. Updated System Prompt (/backend/src/mastra/prompts/system.word.simplified.txt)
- Clear guidance on using short anchor texts
- Examples of each tool usage
- Emphasis on reading document first before editing

### 4. Stream Handler Updates (/backend/src/mastra/streamHandler.ts)
- Connected to tool bridge via EventEmitter
- Fixed text extraction from various Mastra chunk formats
- Properly handles tool execution requests

## What's Been Completed (2025-09-12 Update)

### Frontend Implementation DONE
✅ Created new context-based tool implementations:
- `/addin/WordClaudeEditor/src/tools/context/InsertTextTool.ts`
- `/addin/WordClaudeEditor/src/tools/context/ReplaceTextTool.ts`
- `/addin/WordClaudeEditor/src/tools/context/DeleteTextTool.ts`
- `/addin/WordClaudeEditor/src/tools/context/InsertTableTool.ts`
- `/addin/WordClaudeEditor/src/tools/context/ReadDocumentTool.ts`
- `/addin/WordClaudeEditor/src/tools/context/AddCommentTool.ts`

✅ Registered new tools in `/addin/WordClaudeEditor/src/tools/index.ts`
✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
✅ Build succeeded with new tool implementations

### Anchor Text Search Fix (Latest)
✅ Added whitespace normalization to all context-based tools:
- Removes line breaks (`\r\n`) from anchor text before searching
- Normalizes multiple spaces to single spaces
- Handles multi-line text properly

✅ Updated system prompt to instruct agent:
- Never include line breaks in anchor text
- Use text from single lines only
- Added examples of correct vs incorrect anchor usage

## What Still Needs Testing

### Remaining Issues to Verify
1. Test that document reading returns content properly
2. Verify table insertion works without errors
3. Confirm text streaming displays in UI
4. Test full agent flow with new position-based tools

## Current Server Status
- Backend running on https://localhost:3000 (process e3050d)
- Frontend dev server on https://localhost:3001 (existing process)

## Testing Approach
Once frontend is updated, test with requests like:
- "Add a table after the introduction paragraph"
- "Replace the first paragraph with new content"
- "Insert a new section at the end of the document"

## Key Files Modified
1. `/backend/src/mastra/tools/toolBridge.ts` - NEW: Async tool bridge
2. `/backend/src/mastra/tools/contextTools.ts` - NEW: Simplified tools
3. `/backend/src/mastra/prompts/system.word.simplified.txt` - NEW: Updated prompt
4. `/backend/src/mastra/agent.word.ts` - MODIFIED: Using new tools
5. `/backend/src/mastra/streamHandler.ts` - MODIFIED: Connected to bridge


## Next Steps
1. Update frontend AgentService.ts to handle new tool format
2. Implement position-based editing logic in frontend
3. Test full flow with Word document
4. Clean up orphaned processes (many old npm/node processes running)
5. Verify text streaming displays in UI

## Important Context
User explicitly requested "fundamental solutions, not workarounds" and wanted the approach similar to how coding agents work with text anchors. The 30-50 character anchor approach was chosen to work within Word's API limitations while providing reliable positioning.
